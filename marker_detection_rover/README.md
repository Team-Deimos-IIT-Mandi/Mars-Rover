# Description
**Detection of Aruco Markers using OpenCV library.**         
The image information is coming from a ROS Topic published by Zed Stereo Camera.   
For better recognition, Adaptive histogram equalization applied.   
For one marker, the position of the middle point of the ARUCO Marker is published as a ROS Topic.  
For 2 markers, the position of the between point of the markers is published as a ROS Topic.

## GTU Rover
This ROS package was made for use in the [GTU Rover](https://youtu.be/uv-LEvk_AX8?t=205) team's URC competition.

**Between Point Detection** - You can see the position of the between point of the markers as a red dot. Information of the position is also published as ROS topic

## Prerequisites

Before you can launch and detect Aruco Markers in the Gazebo World, make sure to install the correct version of openCV in your system:

1. Uninstall the current OpenCV package:

   ```bash
    pip uninstall opencv-python
    ```

2. Install the opencv-contrib-python package:

    ```bash
   pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.2.0.32
    ```

## Launching Aruco Detection

Open your terminal and follow the below given instructions to launch Aruco  detection with our rover:

1. Launch the "Rover_spawn_with_aruco_detection.launch" file:

   ```bash
     roslaunch rover_description Rover_spawn_with_aruco_detection.launch 
    ```

2. Rover is not spawning correctly, so manually rotate it and make sure that it is upright.

3. Make sure the aruco Marker is visible in the "image Window" which will open after you launch the above file
