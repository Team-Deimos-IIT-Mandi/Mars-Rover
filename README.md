run euroc.launch in vins_estimator, you will most probably see repeating restarts of the estimator 

  tried --> frequency changes in camera topic , publish the feature image with same rate as of the input image topic --> didnt solve
       --> ensuring use of sim_time for both cam and imu --> didnt solve

       
  see the configs again i might miss something formula to get the focus values in extrinsic param has a very low chance of being wrong so needs checking :(
